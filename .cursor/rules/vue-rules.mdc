# PrimeVue Usage Rules

## Component Import and Usage
- Always import PrimeVue components individually from their specific paths (e.g., `import Button from 'primevue/button'`)
- Never use global component registration unless explicitly needed
- Use TypeScript types provided by PrimeVue components when available

## Theme and Configuration
- Use the configured Aura theme consistently across all components
- Follow PrimeVue's CSS classes and styling conventions
- Avoid overriding PrimeVue component styles unless absolutely necessary

## Component Guidelines
- Use PrimeVue form components (InputText, Password, Button, etc.) instead of native HTML elements for forms
- Leverage PrimeVue's Message component for error/success notifications instead of custom solutions
- Use Card component for content containers when appropriate
- Prefer PrimeVue's DataTable for tabular data display
- Use Dialog component for modals and overlays

## Best Practices
- Always check component props and events in PrimeVue documentation (can be found on https://primevue.org/) before implementation
- Use severity props (success, info, warn, error) consistently across Message components
- Follow PrimeVue's accessibility guidelines and ARIA attributes
- Use PrimeVue's responsive utilities and grid system when available
