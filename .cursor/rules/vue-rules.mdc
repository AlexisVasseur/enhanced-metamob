- when u create a vue file, make it in this order :
```vue
<script lang=ts>
</script>
<template>
</template>
<style scoped>
</style>

```

- never use watch function
- group element by business

When creating a page [Feature]
- Vue file is named [Feature]Page.vue
- you add an entry in the router/index.ts file that match the [Feature]
